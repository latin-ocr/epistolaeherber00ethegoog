lniond Dr J. Allan Giles L. L. D.‚ whose rese-
archos ara so well known, and whose lile ol the
venorable Beda would alone have ensnred his
reputation, l am enablod to edit the letters ol Os-
· bert ol Clara and Elmerius ol Canterbury.

Tho’ all my ellorls lo llnow light on lhe his-
tory ol these ancient writers have proved un-

without interest.

anknowledgments to my friend Mons. SchayeS,
to whose kind assistance, l must ina great mea-
sure ascribe any success whjch may attend my

. editorial labours. R. A.
